# OpenCore EFI for Acer Aspire V3-571G

The wifi+bluetooth card that ships with the device is completely incompatible with macOS. Sleep works fine. Nvidia GPU is disabled as it uses Nvidia Optimus which is not supported on macOS.

The serial number is removed.

SMBIOS is MacBookPro11,1 to run macOS Big Sur
