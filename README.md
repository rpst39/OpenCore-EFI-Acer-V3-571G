# OpenCore EFI for Acer Aspire V3-571G

The wifi+bluetooth card that ships with the device is completely incompatible with macOS. Also on macOS it just refuses to enter sleep mode. Nvidia GPU is disabled as it uses Nvidia Optimus which is not supported on macOS.

The serial number is removed.

SMBIOS is MacBookPro9,2
